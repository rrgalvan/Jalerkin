# Jalerkin

Galerkin method in JuliaLang

Simple library, designed just for learning and for fun :) See the examples for a quick tutorial

Our goal is simply to explore Galerkin-type methods, without obligations or conditions. In Julia there is a much more elaborate general purpos library: [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap), by S. Bad√≠a, F. Verdugo et al. Where possible we will try to keep close to Gridp and use a similar syntax.
